I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I am co-advised by Dr.
Nisar Ahmed and Dr. Daniel Szafir. I am part of the [Cooperative Human Robot Intelligence (COHRINT) Laboratory](https://cohrint.info/)
at CU Boulder, and the [Interactive Robotics and Novel Technologies (IRON) Laboratory](http://iron-lab.org/) at UNC Chapel Hill.

My goal is to build autonomous machines that can serve as trusted teammates and partners to human users. To that end, my research
focuses on two main areas:

<b>Competency self-assessments for autonomous robots:</b> We are developing a suite of algorithms which use
statistical techniques to help autonomous robots quantify their own capabilities and limitations. I am interested in (1)
how we can leverage knowledge of a robot's existing models, planners, and control policies to make predictions about
their competencies, and (2) how communication of competency assessments can influence decision-making within a
human-robot/machine team.

<b>Mission planning and decision support:</b> We are developing experimental mission planning tools in order to
evaluate competency-aware ground robots in the field. We are also working with the United States Space Force to develop
decision aids and related algorithms for remote sensing and data exploitation missions. The primary goal is to explore
how autonomy can augment human operators, provide them with the information they need to make informed decisions, and
improve task or mission performance.

Prior to pursuing PhD, I spent several years in aerospace R&D where I worked on algorithms and software for
real-world applications including Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) mission planning, battlespace decision-support, and
space situational awareness. I also spent a few years in the US Army Airborne Infantry adventuring throughout the
world and jumping out of perfectly good aircraft.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (2014), and my M.S. in Computer
Science from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell (2018).
