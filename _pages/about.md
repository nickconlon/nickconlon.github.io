I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder co-advised by Prof.
Nisar Ahmed and Prof. Daniel Szafir. I am part of the [Cooperative Human Robot Intelligence (COHRINT) Laboratory](https://cohrint.info/)
at CU Boulder, and the [Interactive Robotics and Novel Technologies (IRON) Laboratory](http://iron-lab.org/) at UNC Chapel Hill. 

My research focuses on developing methods for robotic machines to assess their own competencies (known as machine 
self-confidence assessment) and investigating the impacts of communicating such assessments within a human-machine
team. Prior to pursuing PhD, I spent several years in aerospace R&D where I developed algorithms and software for
real-world applications including Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) mission planning, battlespace decision-support, and
space situational awareness. I also spent a few years in the US Army Airborne Infantry adventuring throughout the
world and jumping out of perfectly good aircraft. 

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (2014), and my M.S. in Computer
Science from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell (2018).
