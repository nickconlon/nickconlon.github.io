I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I am co-advised by Dr.
Nisar Ahmed and Dr. Daniel Szafir. I am part of the [Cooperative Human Robot Intelligence (COHRINT) Laboratory](https://cohrint.info/)
at CU Boulder, and the [Interactive Robotics and Novel Technologies (IRON) Laboratory](http://iron-lab.org/) at UNC Chapel Hill.

My goal is to build autonomous machines that can serve as trusted teammates and partners to human users. To that end, my research
focuses on <b>competency self-assessment</b>, which uses introspective techniques to help autonomous agents quantify
their own capabilities and limitations. I am particularly interested in how communication of such assessments influences
decision-making within a human-machine team. In addition, I have a broad interest in human-machine teaming, trust, robotic
autonomy, mission planning, decision support, and field robotics.

Prior to pursuing PhD, I spent several years in aerospace R&D where I developed algorithms and software for
real-world applications including Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) mission planning, battlespace decision-support, and
space situational awareness. I also spent a few years in the US Army Airborne Infantry adventuring throughout the
world and jumping out of perfectly good aircraft.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (2014), and my M.S. in Computer
Science from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell (2018).
