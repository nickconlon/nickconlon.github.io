This project is for a human subject study evaluation of the Event-Triggered Generalized Outcome
Assessment (ET-GOA) algorithm.

ET-GOA leverages the Generalized Outcome Assessment (GOA) and Model Quality Assessment (MQA) metrics
from Factorized Machine Self-Confidence (FaMSeC) to enable an autonomous robot to understand when
and how its competency changes during task execution. This project extends the following:

[Event-triggered robot self-assessment to aid in autonomy adjustment](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2023.1294533/full)

[Dynamic Competency Self-Assessment for Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01646)


This project is in progress. I will post papers and code when it is complete.
