This is an in-progress project and soon to be human subject study evaluation of a competency aware robotic system. We
are interested in how human users employ robots that are able to quantify and communicate their own competencies with 
respect to the tasks they are assigned and the environments they are operating in. More information will be posted after
the project is complete.

This project extends the following:
