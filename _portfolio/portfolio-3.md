title: "Evaluating a Competency-Aware Robot for an Autonomous Exploration Mission"
excerpt: "A project to investigate how human users employ robots capable of quantifying, communicating, and updating estimates of their competency."
collection: portfolio

This was a (N=21) human subject where we evaluated how a human user could work with and utilize a live competency-aware 
ground robot for area exploration. We were interested how a robot capable of predicting its competencies <i>a priori</i>,
and updating that prediction <i>in situ</i>, can help participants balance attending to the robot with completing
adjacent tasks. More information will be posted shortly.
