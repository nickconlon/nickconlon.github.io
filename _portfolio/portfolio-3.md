title: "Evaluating a Competency-Aware Robot System for an Autonomous Exploration Mission"
excerpt: "A project to investigate how human users employ robots capable of quantifying, communicating, and updating estimates of their competency."

This is an in-progress project and soon to be human subject study evaluation of a competency aware robotic system. We
are interested in how human users employ robots that are able to quantify and communicate their own competencies --
both <i>a priori</i> estimates and <i>in situ</i> updates -- with respect to the tasks they are assigned and the
environments they are operating in. More information will be posted after the project is complete.
