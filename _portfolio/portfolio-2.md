This project is for the evaluation of the Event-Triggered Generalized Outcome Assessment (ET-GOA) algorithm using both
a simulated and live robot.

ET-GOA leverages the Generalized Outcome Assessment (GOA) and Model Quality Assessment (MQA) metrics from Factorized
Machine Self-Confidence (FaMSeC) to enable an autonomous robot to understand when and how its competency changes during
task execution. This project extends the following:

[Generalizing Competency Self-Assessment for Autonomous Vehicles Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2022-2496)

[Dynamic Competency Self-Assessment for Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01646)
