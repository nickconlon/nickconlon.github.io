This was an (N=155) human subject study where we evaluated how communication of an agent's <i>a priori</i> competency 
assessment impacted users decision-making when there was uncertainty about the state of the world and the robot's
capabilities. We formulated this as a grid-world game where participants had to supervise the robot and either (1) allow
the robot to autonomously navigate to a goal, or (2) manually drive the agent to the goal using a simple up/down/left/right
interface. We leveraged the Outcome Assessment from Factorized Machine Self-Confidence as our robot assessment framework.
We found that communication of the robot's competency let to improved task performance, more informed choices of
autonomy level, and participant trust calibrated with the agent's capabilities.
