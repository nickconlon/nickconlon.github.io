This project is for a human subject study to evaluate the Outcome Assessment algorithm. We investigated how knowledge of robot competency impacts human decision-making when there is uncertainty about the state of the world and the robot's capabilities.

The Outcome Assessment metric from Factorized Machine Self-Confidence enables an autonomous robot to understand its task competency. This project extends the following:
